2. How can blockchain users mine coins?
They user their computers to solve hashes given by the creaters of the blockchain.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
Cellular Automata are useful for situations that require modelling complicated and non-linear systems. Which could include uses in physics, computer science, engineering.
